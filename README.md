# E-commerece


E-commerce website created as a model to show interested clients, in my freelancer services, how his/her online shop could look like. This website was created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) and uses Braintree Sandbox as the testing payment service. It was deployed using Digital Ocean services.
